I don’t know about you guys, but most often, after, or actually even during, meetings I start to feel like a zombie. They shamble on longer than they should, eat your brains (or at least your energy), and refuse to die.

We’ve all sat through the way too long, way too dry, “Weekly Status Update” where 15 people sit in a circle reading line items off a spreadsheet, all of which could have been an email. It’s inefficient, it’s expensive, and frankly, it kills morale.


As a fractional CMO, I step into organizations that are often drowning in these zombie meetings. My first move isn’t usually to add more process, but to refine the communication architecture so actual work can get done.

This is how I developed the **Graveyard Meeting**.

It sounds morbid, but the philosophy is simple: **We meet to bury the past week so we can live for the next one.**

The structure is strict, fast, and driven by a simple acronym: **R.I.P.**

### 1. R is for Report (The Autopsy)
*“What happened last week?”*

The goal here is not storytelling; it’s data verification. We aren’t here to relive the glory or the trauma of the last week, we are here to record it.

- What to cover: KPIs, shipped deliverables, and hard numbers.
- The Rule: If it’s green, we skip it. If it’s red, we note it. Do not spend 20 minutes explaining why a number was good. We bury the data and move on.
### 2. I is for Issues & Impacts (The Bottlenecks)
*“What is holding up the work?”*

This is the only part of the meeting where debate is allowed, BUT the catch is, keep it short. This section is for “Blockers and Knock-ons.”

- Issues: I can’t finish the landing page because the code broke.
- Impacts: Graphics are late on the social assets; the social media manager cannot schedule the posts for Tuesday.
- The Goal: Identification and assignment. Don’t solve the problem in the meeting; assign two people to solve it after the meeting.
### 3. P is for Projects & Programs (The Resurrection)
*“What are we doing next?”*

Now that the past is buried and the blockers are identified, we look forward.

- Projects: Tactical execution. “We are launching the email sequence on Thursday.”
- Programs: Strategic alignment. “We are entering Week 2 of the Q1 Brand Awareness campaign.”
- The Outcome: Everyone leaves the room knowing exactly what “Done” looks like for the coming week.

### Why the Graveyard Works
The psychological shift of the “Graveyard” is powerful. By treating the past week as “dead,” you remove the emotional attachment to it. You stop dwelling on Monday’s failure and start focusing on next Monday’s success.

It forces accountability. You can’t hide in a Graveyard meeting. You either have the Report, you have an Issue, or you have a Project. If you have none of those, you don’t need to be in the meeting.

Stop letting zombie meetings eat your team’s productivity. Bury the busy work. R.I.P. the status quo.
